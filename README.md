# Project Title - **WRITEFULLY YOURS**

# Project Description
## Background
The concept of this project originated from a personal interest in stationery, specifically pens and pencils. Despite having a significant amount of stationery on my desk, I have a penchant for collecting them. There are some blogs/website shared the reviews on the stationery. But it is more like a blog with long essay format review and it is hard to find the specific item that user is looking for. Therefore, I decided to create a website, WRITEFULLY Yours, where individuals who share the same passion as mine could explore, review, and discuss their favorite stationery items. 

## Goals of the Project
- To allow users to browse a wide range of stationery items.
- To allow users to share their experiences and opinions of the products listed on the website.
- To users to contribute by adding new items to the existing collections.


## Features
There are 3 main features in **WRITEFULLY YOURS**. These are:
- Browse in the Stationery Hub
- Share your thoughts
- Contribute to the Collection.

Details of the features have been elaborated in below.

### Browse in the Stationery Hub
As a user of WRITEFULLY Yours, you will be able to browse a wide range of stationery items, including pens, pencils, notebooks, markers, and other similar products. Each collection will feature an array of stationery items that serve unique purposes, and users can explore these products in-depth.

### Share your thoughts
Furthermore, users can share their experiences and opinions of the products listed on the website, providing valuable insights for stationery enthusiasts. As a stationery lover myself, I understand the importance of having comprehensive product information before making a purchase.

### Contribute to the Collection
The website will also allow users to contribute by adding new items to the existing collections. This feature will provide other users with an opportunity to review and share their opinions, making the website a comprehensive platform for all stationery enthusiasts.

## Technologies Involved
This stationery review website uses a couples of modern technologies to allow a seamless and interactive user experience. Technologeis involved are vue.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDb.

### Front-end Technologies
In terms of  front-end, the website is implemented by using Vue.js, which is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js enables the website to be more responsive and dynamic and allow users to easily explore and navigate through the website and interact with the features.

In terms of design, it is built by using HTML and CSS, which allows for a clean and visually appealing layout to allow user to have seamless experience for various screen sizes. Another popular front-end framework so called - Bootstrap is also used to ensure consistency and ease of development.


### Back-end Technologeis
On the back-end, the website is implemented using Express.js and Node.js. Both are JavaScript-based technologies that facilitate server-side programming. These technologies asist to handle incoming requests, perform data validation, and execute other important tasks required for the website to serve its purpose.

Finally, MongoDB which is a NoSQL database, is used to store and manage the data for the website, such as user profiles and product reviews. This allows for efficient data management and retrieval, as well as scalability as the website grows. Overall, these technologies work together to provide a modern and efficient platform for users to review and explore stationery products.
